# TODO Evolution

This is a collection of projects that will build upon each other to explore different ways of programming to achieve a similar goal, with increasing levels of complexity. It provides an opportunity to look at contexts of program execution that can found during software development, from standalone scripts to UI applications.

The intention is that this prject will be a monorepo of all the sub-projects.
